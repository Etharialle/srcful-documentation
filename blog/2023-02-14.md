Srcful is excited to announce the latest installations of our energy gateway prototypes. These devices are the backbone of our platform, allowing home owners to connect their solar panels and batteries to the Srcful community and earn tokens for contributing to the energy market.

Our energy gateway prototypes are compatible with the most common brands of inverters and batteries in the world. They provide a digital identity to distributed energy resources (DERs), allowing them to transact and prove their energy data on the blockchain. This makes it possible for micro-producers to participate in previously closed ecosystems and monetize their contributions through services like ancillary services.

The latest installations of our energy gateway prototypes are a significant milestone for our team. We have worked hard to develop a device that is both energy-efficient and secure, with the ability to provide Proof-of-Source and Proof-of-Control. This is the act of proving that the inverters are connected and able to be controlled on demand when delivering flexibility services to the grid. By providing this proof, home owners can earn SRC tokens and contribute to a more sustainable and decentralized energy system.

The first batch of our energy gateway prototypes, called Solaris, have been installed with inverters from Sungrow, Huawei, and Solaredge. These three brands represent a significant portion of the global market for home inverters, according to a September 2021 report from ResearchAndMarkets. Solaredge had a market share of approximately 38%, followed by Huawei with approximately 23%, and Sungrow with approximately 14%.

At Srcful, we are committed to revolutionizing the energy market by providing a decentralized community that empowers home owners to participate in the energy market and monetize their contributions. Our energy gateway prototypes are a critical component of our platform, and we are excited to see them in action.

We are currently working on expanding our installations to new markets and continuing to refine our devices. We are excited to be at the forefront of a new era in energy, and we invite you to join us on this journey.
