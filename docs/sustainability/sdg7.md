<b>United Nations Sustainable Development Goal - 7</b><br />
<i>Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all.</i>
</div><br />

SDG7 is a United Nations Sustainable Development Goal which aims to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all by 2030. Srcful's mission to create a decentralized and sustainable energy grid is directly aligned with this goal, and the platform has the potential to make a significant impact in achieving SDG7.

By enabling individuals and communities to generate and consume green energy, Srcful is helping to promote a more sustainable energy system that is accessible and affordable for all. The platform's use of blockchain technology and distributed energy resources can help to create a more reliable and efficient energy grid, reducing the need for centralized power plants and promoting the integration of renewable energies.

In addition, the Srcful platform can also help to reduce energy poverty and improve energy access in developing countries by enabling individuals and communities to generate their own energy and connect to a decentralized energy grid. This can help to reduce reliance on fossil fuels and traditional energy sources, which can be expensive and often inaccessible to those in remote or underserved areas.

Overall, Srcful's focus on creating a sustainable and decentralized energy grid is an important step towards achieving SDG7 and promoting a more sustainable and equitable future for all.
