# Environment

Srcful is dedicated to making a positive impact on the environment, and promoting the use of sustainable energy sources is a key part of this commitment. One of the ways Srcful is working to achieve this is by offering incentives to encourage the development and implementation of solar and other sustainable power sources. By providing financial support for these initiatives, Srcful aims to increase the use of renewable energy sources and reduce reliance on fossil fuels.
