# Sourceful Energy Simplified


<div class="alert alert--primary" role="alert">
Are you just feeling overwhelmed by all the information about Sourceful Energy? Don't worry, you're not alone! That's why we've created this page for people who are new to the concept.
</div><br />

First of all, it's important to know that Sourceful Energy is all about clean and sustainable energy. We believe that the world needs to move away from dirty fossil fuels and embrace green energy sources like solar and wind power. But we also know that the transition won't happen overnight and without challenges. That's where Sourceful Energy comes in.

:::tip Did you know?
The name "Sourceful" is a play on the word "reSourceful," reflecting the goal of the platform to enable individuals to take control of their energy resources and contribute to a more sustainable future.

Sourceful Energy is all about building a decentralized energy grid thatâ€™s sustainable, efficient, and fair for everyone. If you have solar panels on your roof or a home battery system, the Sourceful Energy Gateway lets you connect to our network. It tracks how much energy you produce and use, and you get rewarded for sharing this data and joining in on energy services. You'll get access to different marketplaces where you can play a role in making the power grid more stable. By connecting many small green energy sources like solar panels and batteries, we can work together to keep the grid balanced and prevent blackouts.

It's also worth noting that Sourceful Energy uses blockchain technology, which is a way to keep track of transactions and ensure they're secure and transparent. It might sound complicated, but think of it like a digital ledger that everyone can see and no one can cheat.

Sourceful Energy is part of the Helium ecosystem as the ENERGY subnetwork. This integration allows us to leverage Helium's established infrastructure while focusing on our specific goal of creating a decentralized energy grid.

There is a common misunderstanding that Sourceful is a peer-to-peer energy trading platform. However, it is important to clarify that while it enables the validation and rewarding of green energy production, it is not currently a platform for peer-to-peer energy trading. This may be a possibility in the future as we continue to develop and expand the capabilities of the platform.

## SRC beta-tokens and Cryptocurrencies

Cryptocurrencies are a type of digital currency that is secured by advanced computer encryption methods called cryptography. They are decentralized, which means that they operate independently of governments and financial institutions. Instead of being controlled by a central authority, cryptocurrencies rely on a network of computers and algorithms to maintain their security and integrity.

:::info Beta Phase
We are currently in the beta phase, during which participants are rewarded with SRC beta-tokens on the Solana devnet. These tokens are for testing purposes only and are not tradeable.

ENERGY tokens are the utility tokens used within the Sourceful Energy ecosystem. By connecting their renewable energy resources to the Sourceful Energy network and contributing to a more sustainable energy system, participants can earn ENERGY tokens. These tokens represent your participation in the network and can be used to access various services and features within the Sourceful Energy platform.

ENERGY tokens serve multiple purposes:
1. Rewards for contributing green energy to the network
2. Access to energy services and features on the platform
3. Participation in network governance

As Sourceful Energy grows and develops, the ENERGY token will play a crucial role in incentivizing sustainable energy practices and fostering a community-driven approach to energy management.

## Rewards and Energy Services
Sourceful Energy offers two main ways for participants to benefit from the network: baseline rewards and energy services.

### Baseline Rewards
Baseline rewards are designed to incentivize consistent participation in the Sourceful Energy network. When you connect your renewable energy source (like solar panels or a home battery) to the network through the Sourceful Energy Gateway, you'll earn rewards for sharing data about your energy production and consumption. These rewards are based on factors such as:

- How long you've been connected to the network
- The quality and frequency of the data you provide
- The type of energy resource you're sharing

By providing this valuable data, you're helping to create a more comprehensive and accurate picture of the decentralized energy landscape, which is crucial for improving grid efficiency and stability.

### Energy Services
Energy services represent the larger portion of potential rewards and involve actively participating in grid stabilization and Virtual Power Plant (VPP) activities. Here's how it works:

- After connecting to the network and meeting certain qualifications, you can opt to make your energy resource (like your home battery) available for grid services.
- Energy companies and grid operators can then utilize your resource as part of a larger Virtual Power Plant to help balance the grid during times of high demand or to integrate more renewable energy.
- When your resource is used for these services, you earn additional rewards, even if your specific device isn't called upon. It's like being on standby to help the grid - you're rewarded for being available and ready to contribute.

By participating in energy services, you're not selling your energy. Instead, you're offering the ability to help stabilize the power grid, and you get rewarded for that availability and contribution. This system helps create a more reliable and efficient energy grid while providing you with additional benefits for your participation.

Through these reward mechanisms, Sourceful Energy aims to create a win-win situation where individuals are incentivized to contribute to a more sustainable and resilient energy system, all while earning rewards for their participation.

## The Sourceful Energy Gateway
The Sourceful Energy Gateway is a small device that connects your renewable energy source, such as solar panels or home batteries, to the Sourceful Energy network. The hardware is intentionally kept simple to reduce costs and environmental impact. It measures key aspects of your energy system, such as energy production, consumption, and grid frequency, and sends this data to the Sourceful Energy network. By connecting your renewable energy source to the network through the Energy Gateway, you can help create a more sustainable and decentralized energy system while earning rewards for your contributions.

## Benefits for You
Connecting to Sourceful Energy can provide households with several benefits:

- **Earn Rewards**: By connecting to Sourceful Energy, households with renewable energy systems can earn tokens for sharing their energy data and participating in grid services.
- **Support the Environment**: By optimizing the use of renewable energy and helping to balance the grid, you're contributing to a more sustainable energy system and helping reduce carbon emissions.
- **Enhance Grid Stability**: By participating in the Sourceful Energy network, you can help balance the grid by allowing your energy resources to be part of a larger **Virtual Power Plant**. This helps prevent power outages and ensures that the grid remains stable as we integrate more renewable energy.
- **Join a Community**: By connecting to Sourceful Energy, you become part of a larger community of like-minded individuals who are committed to sustainable energy practices. This community can provide **support, advice, and inspiration** to help you maximize the benefits of your renewable energy system.
- **Increase the Value of Your Energy System**: By participating in energy services, you can potentially increase the **return on investment** for your solar panels or home battery, as you're now able to earn rewards beyond just reducing your electricity bill.
- **Contribute to Innovation**: As a participant in Sourceful Energy, you're at the forefront of the **renewable energy revolution**, helping to shape the future of how we produce, consume, and share energy.

By participating in Sourceful Energy, you're not just benefiting yourself, but you're also playing a crucial role in creating a more sustainable, efficient, and resilient energy future for everyone.
