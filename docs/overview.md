# Srcful Documentation

## Participate in shaping the future of energy with Srcful

### What is Srcful? 
Srcful primarily exists to accelerate and facilitate the expansion of renewable energy sources. Srcful aims to build the worldâ€™s largest virtual power plant (VPP). We build the VPP by connecting Decentralized Energy Resources (DERs), such as solar plants and battery storage, into a decentralized network.

**Our mission: Accelerate solar power.**

### How does it work?
By connecting your solar inverter to our Energy Gateway, you will be rewarded for your verified green energy production. In a later stage, you will also be rewarded for letting us control your solar plant, to help stabilize the energy grid.

Our documentation covers everything from the Srcful Energy Gateway to Tokenomics and other important resources. It also contains the [Srcful Whitepaper](/whitepaper/), which comprehensively details the foundational principles, technological architecture, and strategic vision of Srcful.<br />

We are committed to sustainability and ensuring that our users have a seamless experience, which is why we put a heavy emphasis on maintaining our documentation.
