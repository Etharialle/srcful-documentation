# Sourceful Documentation

## Participate in shaping the future of energy with Sourceful

### What is Sourceful? 

Sourceful is pioneering the ENERGY subnetwork within the Helium ecosystem to accelerate and facilitate the expansion of renewable energy sources. Our goal is to build the world's largest decentralized virtual power plant (VPP) by connecting Distributed Energy Resources (DERs), such as solar plants and battery storage, into a decentralized network.

**Our mission: Accelerate solar power and stabilize the energy grid.**

### How does it work?
By connecting your solar inverter or battery to our Energy Gateway, you'll be rewarded with ENERGY tokens for your verified green energy production. In the future, you'll also be rewarded for allowing control of your solar plant or battery to participate in grid stabilization and other energy services.

We're currently in a beta phase, offering early adopters a unique opportunity to shape the future of decentralized energy. Beta testers are rewarded with SRC beta-tokens on Solana devnet. When we fully launch on the Helium network, beta participants will receive ENERGY tokens as a recognition of their early involvement and contributions during the beta phase.

Our documentation covers everything from the Sourceful Energy Gateway to Tokenomics and other important resources. It also contains the [Sourceful Whitepaper](/whitepaper/), which comprehensively details the foundational principles, technological architecture, and strategic vision of Sourceful.<br />

Join us in exploring the exciting possibilities of a smart, decentralized energy grid with Sourceful.

## Getting started: Sourceful Simplified

If you're new to Sourceful, we recommend beginning your journey at the [Sourceful Simplified](/simplified/) page. This section is designed to provide newcomers with an introduction to Sourceful.

## Explore the Energy Gateway

The Energy Gateway was initially part of our beta program but has been discontinued. We now focus solely on being compatible with Helium IoT hotspots where our firmware can run. Our first partner in this endeavor is RAKWireless.

The Energy Gateway will be compatible with existing Helium Hotspots, allowing for dual mining of both IOT and ENERGY tokens. This integration enables users to participate in both networks simultaneously, maximizing the utility and potential rewards of their hardware.

For more information about our current approach and partnerships, please visit our [Partners page](/partners/).
