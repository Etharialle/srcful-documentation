# Using Srcful

The Srcful platform incentivizes users to contribute to a sustainable and decentralized energy system through two models: Proof-of-Source (PoS) and Proof-of-Control (PoC). With PoS, users can earn rewards for their green energy contributions when a Distributed Energy Resource (DER) produces green energy and is validated through the Srcful network. PoC provides an additional way for DER owners to earn rewards by allowing Srcful to sell the power generated by the DER on the flexibility grid service markets. The balancing authorities purchase clusters of DERs, and payments for power sold by Srcful are used to buy and burn SRC tokens, benefiting all token holders. By participating in PoS and PoC, users can contribute to a sustainable energy system and earn rewards for their contributions.

## PoS

When a Distributed Energy Resource (DER) connected to the Srcful network produces green energy, the amount of energy produced is measured by the Energy Gateway and sent to the Srcful network for validation through Proof-of-Source (PoS).

If the energy source is validated, the DER owner is rewarded with SRC tokens based on the scale of validation and the percentage of the total green energy created in the network that their DER contributed. The SRC tokens are then sent to the DER owner's Solana wallet, where they can be used to participate in the energy marketplace or exchanged for other cryptocurrencies or fiat currency on various cryptocurrency exchanges.

Overall, PoS is an important part of the Srcful platform's incentive model, as it provides DER owners with a tangible reward for their contributions to the decentralized energy grid. By participating in PoS, DER owners can help create a more sustainable and equitable energy system while earning rewards for their green energy contributions.

## PoC

Proof-of-Control (PoC) is an optional feature in the Srcful platform that allows DER owners to give Srcful control over their DER and sell the power generated or not generated by the DER on the flexibility grid service markets. Balancing authorities buy clusters of DERs to be controlled, typically days in advance. When the DERs are called upon to either turn on or shut down, they are often controlled for a short duration, usually just a few minutes.

Payments from the balancing authorities for power sold by Srcful are used to buy SRC tokens on the open market, which are then burned. The burning of SRC tokens increases the value of remaining tokens and reduces the total supply, providing a benefit to all token holders.

At the same time, DERs participating in the flexibility grid service markets and that fulfill the Srcful validation requirements through Proof-of-Source (PoS) are also paid in SRC tokens. These tokens are sent to the DER owner's Solana wallet, where they can be used to participate in the energy marketplace or exchanged for other cryptocurrencies or fiat currency on various cryptocurrency exchanges.

Overall, PoC provides DER owners with an additional way to earn rewards for their green energy contributions, while also helping to create a more efficient and reliable energy grid through the clustering of DERs. By participating in PoC and PoS, DER owners can contribute to a more sustainable and decentralized energy system while earning rewards for their contributions to the energy marketplace.

## The Beginning of a Sustainable Energy Future

The Srcful platform's Proof-of-Source (PoS) and Proof-of-Control (PoC) incentive models provide DER owners with tangible rewards for their green energy contributions to the decentralized energy grid. However, this is just the beginning of what a community of connected DERs can achieve.

As the Srcful community grows and more DERs are connected to the decentralized energy grid, new possibilities emerge for additional incentive models and services.
