# Setting up 

## The Solana Wallet

Setting up a Solana wallet is a simple process that can be completed in a few steps:

1. **Choose a wallet provider:** There are several wallet providers that support Solana, including Exodus, Phantom, and Solflare. Choose one that best suits your needs and follow their instructions for creating a new wallet.

2. **Create a new wallet:** Once you've chosen a wallet provider, follow the instructions to create a new wallet. You'll be asked to choose a secure password and seed phrase, which you should keep in a safe place. **Srcful will never ask you for your seed phrase or password!**

3. **Link your wallet to Srcful:** Finally, link your Solana wallet to Srcful by providing your wallet address when prompted during the sign-up process. This will allow you to receive SRC tokens for contributing green energy to the decentralized grid. When you receive your Energy Gateway, the gateway will be connected to your Solana wallet. 

By following these steps, you'll be able to set up a Solana wallet and start receiving SRC tokens for contributing to the Srcful decentralized energy grid. If you have any questions or issues with setting up your wallet, please refer to your wallet provider's documentation or contact their support team for assistance.
