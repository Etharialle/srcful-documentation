To ensure your Energy Gateway is securely assigned to you, it's essential to set up a Solana Wallet (If you already have a Solana Wallet, you can use your existing one. Each Energy Gateway must be linked to a unique Solana Wallet, serving as a digital proof of ownership and facilitating secure transactions. Solana serves as our primary blockchain infrastructure.

Setting up a Solana wallet is a simple process that can be completed in a few steps:

1. **Choose a wallet provider:** There are several wallet providers that support Solana, including Phantom (preferred) and Solflare. Available as an app for iPhone and Android, plus browser extensions for popular browsers like Chrome. Then follow their instructions for creating a new wallet.

2. **Create a new wallet:** Once you've chosen a wallet provider, follow the instructions to create a new wallet. You'll be asked to choose a secure password and seed phrase, which you have to save and keep in a safe place. **Sourceful will never ask you for your seed phrase or password!**

3. **Link your wallet to Sourceful:** Finally, link your Solana wallet to Sourceful by providing your wallet address when prompted during the sign-up process. This will allow you to receive future token rewards for contributing to Sourceful. When you receive your Energy Gateway, the gateway will be connected to your Solana wallet. 

By following these steps, you'll be able to set up a Solana wallet and start receiving SRC beta-tokens for contributing to the Sourceful decentralized energy grid. If you have any questions or issues with setting up your wallet, please refer to your wallet provider's documentation or contact their support team for assistance.
