# Introduction to Srcful

Welcome to the Srcful Getting Started guide! Srcful is a decentralized Virtual Power Plant using an Energy Gateway with a token-based incentive model for crowdsourcing at scale!

At its core, Srcful mission is to create the worlds largest community-powered virtual power plant (VPP) through the use of distributed energy resources (DERs). This allows individuals to take control of their energy resources, contribute to the grid, and shape the development of next-generation energy services. By injecting decentralization into an industry that is currently dominated by monopolies, we aim to unleash innovation and make renewable energy more accessible and widely adopted by the people.

In this Getting Started guide, we'll provide you with all the information you need to start using the Srcful Energy Gateway and join the energy revolution. Whether you're a homeowner, a developer, or just interested in sustainable energy solutions, our guide will help you get up and running with Srcful in no time.

Join us in creating a more sustainable and decentralized energy system with Srcful.
