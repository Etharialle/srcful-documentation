# Introduction to Srcful

Welcome to the Srcful Getting Started guide! Srcful is a revolutionary platform that aims to accelerate the transition to a more sustainable and decentralized energy system. Our main goal is to address the barriers to entry for renewable energy, lack of incentives and user-friendly technology, and high upfront costs.

At its core, Srcful creates a community-powered virtual power plant (VPP) through the use of distributed energy resources (DERs) combined with the SRC token. This allows individuals to take control of their energy resources, contribute to the grid, and shape the development of next-generation energy services through a community-driven approach. By injecting decentralization into an industry that is currently dominated by monopolies, we aim to unleash innovation and make renewable energy more accessible and widely adopted.

In this Getting Started guide, we'll provide you with all the information you need to start using the Srcful Energy Gateway and join the energy revolution. Whether you're a homeowner, a developer, or just interested in sustainable energy solutions, our guide will help you get up and running with Srcful in no time.

Join us in creating a more sustainable and decentralized energy system with Srcful.
