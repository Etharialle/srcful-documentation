# The Team

> _In the heart of Kalmar, where the salty sea meets land, a team of passionate minds has gathered. Close by, the golden fields sway in the gentle breeze, and the sun casts a warm glow on the island of Ã–land. "The island of the sun and the wind", where nature's resources are abundant and the air is pure. It is here where we find the roots of the team's devotion to sustainable energy._
>
>_With a rich history dating back to the 10th century, Kalmar's traditions of trade and commerce have laid the foundation for a new kind of energy economy. The team at Srcful is inspired by this history, and the potential for blockchain technology to revolutionize the way we produce and consume energy. With a vision for a more sustainable future, the team is dedicated to harnessing the power of natural resources and creating a decentralized energy grid that empowers individuals and communities alike._
