Srcful has created a utility token called the SRC-token ("source token") on the Solana blockchain. Srcful chose to develop on the Solana blockchain due to its speed, efficiency, and strong community. Solana has a successful history of powering major decentralized projects.

The maximum supply of SRC is 250,000,000,000 tokens. These tokens are released gradually and initially allocated as rewards for Proof-of-Source and Proof-of-Control.

:::note Beta phase rewards
During the beta phase, active beta testers and early adopters will be rewarded a set amount of tokens monthly for their engagement in the project. Read more about this in the <a href="../Tokenomics/Distribution/">Tokenomics</a>.
:::

<!-- The amount of SRC-tokens distributed to Energy Gateways depends on the value of their work to the overall network. To earn SRC-tokens, users must demonstrate that their distributed energy resources (DERs) are connected and produce green energy. This is called Proof-of-Source. DER owners can also earn SRC-tokens by allowing a flexibility service provider to use their DERs as a flexible resource, a process called Proof-of-Control. Both of these actions can be completed through the Srcful Energy Gateway. By providing Proof-of-Source and participating in Proof-of-Control, users can earn SRC-tokens as a reward.

The compensation models for Proof-of-Source and Proof-of-Control may be changed in the future by the community to ensure the right incentives are in place to create the best value. 80% of all newly minted tokens will always be distributed back to the community that is participating in and supporting the development of the Srcful Network. 20% goes to founders and investors. -->
