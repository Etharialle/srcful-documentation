Sourceful has created a beta token called the SRC-token ("source token") on the Solana devnet blockchain. This beta token is specifically designed for our beta testers during the pre-launch phase of the ENERGY network. 

Key points about the SRC beta-token:

- It's available only on Solana devnet.
- Users must select "testnet or devnet" in their Solana wallet settings to view and interact with the token.
- The token is non-tradable and has no liquidity pools, as it's intended solely for testing purposes.
- SRC beta-tokens serve as a precursor to the future ENERGY token.

The maximum supply of ENERGY tokens for the ENERGY subnetwork will be 250,000,000,000 tokens, as specified in [HIP-128](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0128-energy-subnetwork.md). During the beta phase, SRC beta tokens are distributed on the Solana devnet. Upon the official launch of the ENERGY network, beta program participants will receive their rewards in proportion to the amount of beta tokens from a dedicated pool of 100,000,000 ENERGY tokens, allocated specifically for early adopters and testers.

:::note Beta phase rewards
During the beta phase, active beta testers and early adopters will be rewarded a set amount of tokens monthly for their engagement in the project. Read more about this in the <a href="../Tokenomics/Distribution/">Tokenomics</a>.

## Post-Beta Phase: ENERGY Token

Upon the official launch of the ENERGY subnetwork within the Helium ecosystem, the SRC beta-token will be replaced by the ENERGY token. Key information about the ENERGY token, as specified in HIP-128:

- Max Supply: 250,000,000,000 ENERGY tokens
- Beta Tester Allocation: 100,000,000 ENERGY tokens reserved for beta program participants
- Token Distribution: Beta program participants will receive ENERGY tokens in proportion to their SRC beta-token holdings

The ENERGY token will facilitate access to a range of services within the Sourceful ecosystem:

- Rewards for DER Integration: Participants will earn ENERGY tokens for connecting Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) through the Sourceful Energy Gateway.
- Burn-and-Mint Equilibrium: The token will operate under this model to ensure a balanced and sustainable token economy.
- Services for DER Owners:

- Advanced energy resource monitoring and analytics
- Performance deviation notifications
- Benchmarking tools for installation comparison
- Solar energy production optimization
- Access to an exclusive energy service marketplace


### Services for Energy Companies:

- Ancillary services with DER control capabilities
- Access to aggregated energy data and insights
Guarantee of Origin certificates for renewable energy traceability


### Virtual Power Plant (VPP) Services (B2B):

- Aggregation of DERs to provide grid stability services
- Demand response management
- Energy trading and load balancing


### Data and API Services (B2B):

- Real-time energy production and consumption data
- Predictive analytics for energy trends
- Integration capabilities for third-party energy management systems


### Sourceful as First Service Provider and Utility Company:

- Sourceful will act as the initial service provider on the ENERGY network
- As a utility company, Sourceful will offer direct energy services to consumers and businesses
- This dual role allows for seamless integration between the token ecosystem and real-world energy services


### Tokenomics Structure:

- 15% of emissions allocated to baseline rewards for network participation
- 45% allocated to service rewards for energy services participation
- Remaining allocations for sensor hosts, service providers, oracles, operations fund, and veHNT delegators as outlined in HIP-128

The ENERGY token and its associated services aim to create a more interconnected and efficient network of energy resources, promoting the growth of decentralized energy systems within the Helium ecosystem. By bridging the gap between tokenized incentives and real-world energy services, Sourceful is positioned to drive innovation in the decentralized energy sector.
