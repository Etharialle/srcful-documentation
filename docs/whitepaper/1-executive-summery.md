# Executive Summary

The main problems that Srcful aims to address are barriers to entry for renewable energy, lack of incentives and user-friendly technology, and high upfront costs. Srcful will create a community powered virtual power plant (VPP) through the use of distributed energy resources (DERs) combined with the SRC-token. This new approach allows individuals to take control of their energy resources, contribute to the grid and shape the development of next-generation energy services through a community-driven approach. This will inject decentralization into an industry that is currently dominated by monopolies, unleash innovation and make renewable energy more accessible and widely adopted.

## Introduction

The rapid transition to renewable energy is imperative in order to meet global climate goals and address the damaging effects of fossil fuels. Despite the urgent need for change, the world continues to heavily rely on and subsidize fossil fuels, with over 180 billion USD in subsidies according to the International Energy Agency. The finite nature and politicized pricing of fossil fuels, coupled with the pollution they cause, have reached critical levels. In fact, research published in Nature suggests that failing to meet the emissions targets outlined in the Paris Agreement could result in economic costs ranging from $150 trillion to $792 trillion by 2100.

As the shift towards renewable energy gathers momentum, production will become increasingly dependent on weather patterns, particularly for wind and solar power. Furthermore, the proliferation of small-scale production facilities, such as solar panels on individual homes, will lead to a more decentralized system that is less predictable than traditional large-scale electric power plants. In order to maintain a stable electricity grid and balance supply and demand, there is a need for controllable resources and incentives for individuals to support the grid with this kind of services.

The transition to renewable and distributed energy resources requires not only a fundamental shift in energy markets and infrastructure, but also in the underlying information technology systems. Srcful aims to address these challenges and facilitate the transition to a more sustainable and decentralized energy system by introducing an Energy Gateway. By utilizing PV-inverters and energy storage, the Energy Gateway allows for the verifiable tracking of renewable energy sources and the facilitation of transactions. The crypto-chip within the Energy Gateway signs transactions for verifiable source, ensuring transparency and reliability within the system. 

With its innovative approach and commitment to a more sustainable future, Srcful have the potential to drive the necessary change towards renewable energy and a more stable and equitable energy market.
