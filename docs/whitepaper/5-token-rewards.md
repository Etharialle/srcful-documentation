# Token Rewards

## Beta phase rewards
During the beta phase, active beta testers and early adopters will be rewarded a set amount of Beta points monthly for their engagement in the project. Read more about this in the <a href="../../tokenomics/rewards/">Tokenomics</a>.

## Post-Beta Phase: ENERGY Token

Upon the official launch of the utility token ENERGY, Beta phase points will be replaced by the ENERGY token. 

The ENERGY token will facilitate access to a range of services within the Sourceful ecosystem:

- Rewards for DER Integration: Contributors will earn rewards for connecting Distributed Energy Resources (DERs).
- Rewards for Services: Contributors will earn extra rewards for participating in selling energy services such as grid balancing.

### Future services for DER Owners:

- Advanced energy resource monitoring and analytics
- Performance deviation notifications
- Benchmarking tools for installation comparison
- Solar energy production optimization
- Access to an exclusive energy service marketplace


### Future services for Energy Companies:

- Aggregation of DERs to provide grid stability services
- Access to aggregated real time energy data and insights
- Integration capabilities for third-party energy management system
- Renewable Energy Certificates.

### Mint and Burn Equilibrium
The ENERGY token will employ a Mint and Burn Equilibrium mechanism to maintain a balanced token supply:

Minting: New tokens are minted to reward contributors for connecting DERs and providing energy services.
Burning: Tokens are burned from the supply when paying customers from the demand side of the energy network use Sourceful's services.

This dynamic equilibrium helps ensure the utility token's value remains stable while incentivizing both supply-side contributions and demand-side usage of the Sourceful ecosystem.
