# Solaris batch


<div class="alert alert--primary" role="alert">
<i>Solaris, a wondrous star nestled in the vastness of the Milky Way galaxy, resides about 4,000 light-years from Earth. Its luminosity illuminates the depths of space, beckoning us to consider the limitless potential for renewable energy in our universe. As we gaze upon its radiance, we are reminded of the urgency to embrace sustainable energy practices on Earth, to harness the power of the sun and all the natural resources available to us, and to continue our pursuit of a brighter, greener future.</i>

The Srcful Energy Gateway (batch #1: "Solaris") is a hardware device designed to connect Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) to the Srcful network of gateways and is compatible with a growing number of inverters. 

The Srcful Energy Gateway provides a digital identity to your Distributed Energy Resource (DER), enabling it to transact and prove its energy data on the blockchain. By connecting your DER to the Srcful network using the Energy Gateway, you can participate in Proof-of-Source and soon to come, Proof-of-Control incentive models, as well as other decentralized energy applications such as ancillary services.

## Features

The Srcful Energy Gateway is a versatile device that offers the following features:

- Support for major inverters: The gateway is compatible with major inverters, making it easy to integrate with existing DER installations using Modbus TCP.

- Rasberry Pi 4 based: The gateway is based on the popular Rasberry Pi platform, which provides high performance and relative low power consumption.

- Wifi connectivity: The gateway supports Wifi connectivity, which allows it to connect to other devices and the internet.

- Helium support: The gateway has Helium support, enabling it to connect to the Helium network for added connectivity options. (Not Solaris batch)

- Secure communication: The gateway uses industry-standard security protocols to ensure that all communication between devices is secure and private.

- Proof-of-Source and Proof-of-Control: The gateway will perform Proof-of-Source mechanism to ensure that energy transactions on the Srcful network are secure and verified. Proof-of-Control is planned to be launced 2024.
