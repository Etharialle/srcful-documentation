# Overview

:::info
You will need a **compatible** DER (Distributed Energy Resource) to connect your Energy Gateway.
:::

## Modbus SunSpec Support

Good news for many DER owners! Our Energy Gateway supports DERs that implement the Modbus SunSpec standard. This means:

**Our Energy Gateway is compatible with all DERs that conform to the Modbus SunSpec standard.**

Modbus SunSpec combines the Modbus communication protocol with the SunSpec data model standard. This combination is widely adopted by DER manufacturers. Our support for Modbus SunSpec significantly expands the range of compatible devices beyond our explicitly listed DER brands.

:::tip
Even if you don't see your specific DER model in our compatibility list below, it may still work with our Energy Gateway if it's SunSpec compliant.
