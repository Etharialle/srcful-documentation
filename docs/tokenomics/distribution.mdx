# Distribution

:::caution
Please note that Srcful is still in Beta and all token rewards should be concidered as non tradeable Beta-tokens.
:::

**Total token supply:** 250 000 000 000 $SRC

The Srcful tokenomic distribution plan outlines how the total supply of SRC token will be distributed over a period of a long period (+30 years). The plan aims to create a fair and equitable distribution of tokens that promotes decentralization and encourages widespread adoption of the Srcful platform.

The distribution plan allocates a certain percentage of tokens to Proof-of-Source mining, Proof-of-Control mining, the Srcful Foundation, and founders and investors. The exact model for our tokenomics will be published when we exit the beta phase.

## Beta Phase Distribution

In a gesture of appreciation and recognition for the active beta testers and early adopters, who have actively engaged in the earliest stages of the project, Srcful has implemented a beta rewards program.

This initiative aims to recognize and celebrate their valuable commitment to growing the platform and their support in fostering a collaborative community. By implementing this rewards program, we not only express our thanks, but also encourage continued active participation, ensuring a mutually beneficial experience for all involved in the beta phase.

During this phase, the pool of beta tokens will be set at **10 million $SRC**. 

Beta testers will share this pool and be rewarded based on their uptime for the previous month. Each beta tester's share of the beta reward token pool will be proportional to their individual uptime relative to the total uptime of all beta testers.
### Distribution schedule

Tokens will be distributed on a set date every month during the beta phase (2024).

| Month     | Date | Completed | Amount         |
| --------- | ---- | --------- | -------------- |
| January   | 12th | ✅        | 4 000 000 $SRC  |

## Proof-of-Source and Proof-of-Control Distribution

**TL;DR:** Srcful's token distribution model is designed to foster the growth and sustainability of a decentralized energy ecosystem. This model aims to reward both the deployment of energy resources and their ongoing management. The token allocation structure is intended to encourage rapid network expansion initially through rewards for new energy gateways. As the network matures, the allocation is planned to shift towards prioritizing the efficient control and utilization of these resources, ensuring long-term network stability and utility. This adaptive approach seeks to align stakeholder interests with the network's evolving needs, supporting the development of a robust and resilient decentralized energy infrastructure.

:::caution Early Adoption Opportunity
As Srcful moves beyond its beta phase, early participation benefits will naturally decrease. By joining now, you can become part of the core community shaping the future of decentralized energy resources. Early adopters not only stand to gain from initial incentives but also play a crucial role in the network's development. Your involvement today could significantly impact the growth and direction of the Srcful ecosystem.

As Srcful exits the beta phase, our token distribution plan is designed to evolve rapidly, matching the pace of innovation in the energy sector. The distribution model balances two critical aspects of our ecosystem: rapid resource deployment and intelligent resource management.

Initially, the token allocation will heavily incentivize the setup of energy gateways and the connection of distributed energy resources (DERs). This approach aims to quickly expand our network's infrastructure, creating a robust foundation for the world's largest decentralized virtual power plant.

As our network grows, the token distribution will gradually shift towards rewarding the efficient control and utilization of these resources. This transition is designed to enhance the overall effectiveness of the DER network, encouraging participants to not just deploy resources, but to actively optimize their performance in real-time.

Our goal is to create a system where approved partners can intelligently orchestrate energy resources, transforming each DER into a vital node in a responsive, smart energy grid. This aligns with Srcful's mission to accelerate decentralization, dramatically increase participation, and build a community of energy innovators.

Srcful is committed to continually expanding the range of services eligible for rewards, staying ahead of the curve in the rapidly evolving energy landscape.

In essence, this model catalyzes the development of decentralized virtual power plants, enabling energy producers of all sizes to become key players in the broader energy market. This approach has the potential to enhance energy security, reduce reliance on centralized power generation, and drive the adoption of renewable energy sources. The result is a more flexible, efficient energy system that not only benefits communities today but shapes the future of energy production and distribution.
