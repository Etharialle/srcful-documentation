# Distribution

:::caution
Please note that Srcful is still in Beta and all token rewards should be concidered as non tradeable Beta-tokens.
:::

**Total token supply:** 250 000 000 000 $SRC

The Srcful tokenomic distribution plan outlines how the total supply of SRC token will be distributed over a period of a long period (+30 years). The plan aims to create a fair and equitable distribution of tokens that promotes decentralization and encourages widespread adoption of the Srcful platform.

The distribution plan allocates a certain percentage of tokens to Proof-of-Source mining, Proof-of-Control mining, the Srcful Foundation, and founders and investors. The exact model for our tokenomics will be published when we exit the beta phase.

## Beta Phase Distribution

In a gesture of appreciation and recognition for the active beta testers and early adopters, who have actively enganged in the earliest stages of the project, Srcful has implemented a beta rewards program.

This initiative aims to recognize and celebrate their valuable commitment to growing the platform and their support in fostering a collaborative community. By implementing this rewards program, we not only express our thanks, but also encourage continued active participation, ensuring a mutually beneficial experience for all involved in the beta phase.

During this phase, the pool of beta tokens will be set at **10 million $SRC**. 

Beta testers will share this pool and be rewarded based on their uptime for the previous month. Each beta tester's share of the beta reward token pool will be proportional to their individual uptime relative to the total uptime of all beta testers.
### Distribution schedule

Tokens will be distributed on a set date every month during the beta phase (2024).

| Month     | Date | Completed | Amount         |
| --------- | ---- | --------- | -------------- |
| January   | 12th | ✅        | 4 000 000 $SRC  |
| February  | 11th | ✅        | 2 000 000 $SRC  |
| March     | 12th | ✅        | 3 000 000 $SRC  |

## Proof-of-Source and Proof-of-Control Distribution

**TL;DR:** In the post-beta phase, our token distribution introduces two key mechanisms: Proof-of-Source (PoSRC) and Proof-of-Control (PoCTRL), the latter being an integral part of the tokenomics' service allocation pot. Over time, the token allocation will shift, with PoSRC's share decreasing while PoCTRL's share increases. This shift incentivizes the setup of energy gateways under PoSRC initially and rewards the ongoing control and management of these resources by approved partners under PoCTRL. These mechanisms are designed to support the sustainable growth of a decentralized energy ecosystem.

:::caution Don't Miss Out!
As we progress beyond the beta phase, the opportunity to benefit from early adoption incentives will diminish. Seize the moment and become part of the foundational community that will reap long-term rewards and influence the direction of the Srcful ecosystem. This is a rare chance to be at the forefront of a revolutionary approach to decentralized energy resources, with the potential for significant token appreciation as our platform scales.
:::

As we exit the beta phase, the current distribution plan will include two mining mechanisms - Proof-of-Source (PoSRC) and Proof-of-Control (PoCTRL) - which receive a certain percentage of tokens each year. The percentage allocated to each mechanism changes over time, with a gradual reduction in the percentage allocated to Proof-of-Source and an increase in the percentage allocated to Proof-of-Control.

The initial emphasis on Proof-of-Source serves as an incentive for users to set up energy gateways and connect their distributed energy resources (DERs), which are essential for activating the Proof-of-Control mechanism. Establishing this infrastructure lays the groundwork for the Proof-of-Control approach, which becomes increasingly lucrative for participants as a higher percentage of tokens is allocated to it. As the allocation for Proof-of-Control rises, we anticipate more user engagement, thereby enhancing the overall efficiency of the DERs network. The PoCTRL, representing the initial suite of mineable services, is only the beginning, and we're committed to expanding the range of services eligible for mining in the future.

The shift to Proof-of-Control lets Srcful's approved partners control their energy resources in order to make every DER smarter. Proof-of-Source and Proof-of-Control are central to Srcful's goal of spreading decentralization, getting more people involved, and building a strong community.

In simpler terms, decentralized virtual power plants are great because they let small energy producers join the larger grid, making energy supply more secure and less reliant on big power plants. This approach is good for the environment, as it uses more renewable energy. It leads to a more flexible energy system, better for the community and the future of energy.
