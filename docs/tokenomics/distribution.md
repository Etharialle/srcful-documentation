# Distribution

The Srcful tokenomic distribution plan outlines how the total supply of SrcToken will be distributed over a period of 30 years. The plan aims to create a fair and equitable distribution of tokens that promotes decentralization and encourages widespread adoption of the Srcful platform.


The distribution plan includes mechanisms to create value for the token, such as token utility, governance, and incentivization programs. The plan allocates a certain percentage of tokens to Proof-of-Source mining, Proof-of-Control mining, and Srcful and its investors. The distribution percentages change each year, with a gradual reduction in the percentage allocated to Proof-of-Source mining and an increase in the percentage allocated to Proof-of-Control over time. Overall, the tokenomic distribution plan is designed to encourage participation, increase liquidity, and build a strong, supportive community of users and investors.

The exact model for our tokenomics will be published when we exit the beta phase.

## Beta Phase Distribution

In a gesture of appreciation and recognition for the active beta testers and early adopters, who have actively enganged in the earliest stages of the project, Srcful has implemented a rewards program that provides these with a set amount of tokens monthly during the beta phase of the project.

This initiative aims to recognize and celebrate their valuable commitment to growing the platform and their support in fostering a collaborative community. By implementing this rewards program, we not only express our thanks, but also encourage continued active participation, ensuring a mutually beneficial experience for all involved in the beta phase.

Beta testers will during this phase be rewarded a set amount of 500 000 tokens monthly for every month their Energy Gateway has had an uptime of at least 7 days.

### Distribution schedule

Tokens will be distributed on a set date every month during the beta phase.

## Proof-of-Source and Proof-of-Control Distribution

The Srcful tokenomic distribution plan will include two mining mechanisms - Proof-of-Source and Proof-of-Control - which receive a certain percentage of tokens each year. The percentage allocated to each mechanism changes over time, with a gradual reduction in the percentage allocated to Proof-of-Source and an increase in the percentage allocated to Proof-of-Control.

The initial focus on Proof-of-Source provides an incentive for users to install energy gateways, which are required for the Proof-of-Control mechanism. This helps to build the infrastructure for the Proof-of-Control mechanism, which becomes more profitable for users as the percentage of tokens allocated to it increases. As the Proof-of-Control mechanism becomes more profitable, it is expected that more users will participate, leading to a greater overall efficiency of the distributed energy resources (DERs). 

The gradual shift towards Proof-of-Control is an important part of the overall strategy for the Srcful platform, as it encourages end-users to let Srcful control their DERs and makes it more profitable for them to do so. This will benefit both the users and the Srcful platform, as it will lead to a larger and more efficient energy grid. By creating a sustainable and profitable business model for all parties involved, the Proof-of-Souce and Proof-of-Control distribution is an integral part of Srcful's strategy to promote decentralization, encourage participation, and build a strong, supportive community of users and investors.
