**Total token supply:** 250 000 000 000 SRC

The Srcful tokenomic distribution plan outlines how the total supply of SRC token will be distributed over a period of a long period (+30 years). The plan aims to create a fair and equitable distribution of tokens that promotes decentralization and encourages widespread adoption of the Srcful platform.

The distribution plan allocates a certain percentage of tokens to Proof-of-Source mining, Proof-of-Control mining, the Srcful Foundation, and founders and investors. The exact model for our tokenomics will be published when we exit the beta phase.

## Beta Phase Distribution

In a gesture of appreciation and recognition for the active beta testers and early adopters, who have actively enganged in the earliest stages of the project, Srcful has implemented a rewards program that provides these with a set amount of tokens monthly during the beta phase of the project.

This initiative aims to recognize and celebrate their valuable commitment to growing the platform and their support in fostering a collaborative community. By implementing this rewards program, we not only express our thanks, but also encourage continued active participation, ensuring a mutually beneficial experience for all involved in the beta phase.

Beta testers will during this phase be rewarded a set amount of 500 000 tokens monthly for every month their Energy Gateway has had an uptime of at least 7 days.

### Distribution schedule

Tokens will be distributed on a set date every month during the beta phase.

|Month|Date|Completed|Amount|
|-----|--------|-----|------|
|January|11th       |âœ…| 4 000 000 tokens|

## Proof-of-Source and Proof-of-Control Distribution

As we exit the beta phase, the current distribution plan will include two mining mechanisms - Proof-of-Source and Proof-of-Control - which receive a certain percentage of tokens each year. The percentage allocated to each mechanism changes over time, with a gradual reduction in the percentage allocated to Proof-of-Source and an increase in the percentage allocated to Proof-of-Control.

The initial focus on Proof-of-Source provides an incentive for users to install energy gateways and connect their DERs, which are required for the Proof-of-Control mechanism. This helps to build the infrastructure for the Proof-of-Control mechanism, which becomes more profitable for users as the percentage of tokens allocated to it increases. As the Proof-of-Control mechanism becomes more profitable, it is expected that more users will participate, leading to a greater overall efficiency of the distributed energy resources (DERs). 

The shift to Proof-of-Control lets Srcful's approved partners control their energy resources in order to make every DER smarter. Proof-of-Source and Proof-of-Control are central to Srcful's goal of spreading decentralization, getting more people involved, and building a strong community. 

In simpler terms, decentralized virtual power plants are great because they let small energy producers join the larger grid, making energy supply more secure and less reliant on big power plants. This approach is good for the environment, as it uses more renewable energy. It leads to a more flexible energy system, better for the community and the future of energy.

### Post Beta Phase Distribution Chart

:::note Important
The token distribution model and tokenomics are still under consideration and have not been finalized. Please note that this section may be subject to updates before the conclusion of the beta phase.

Srcful's tokenomics distribution chart outlines the strategic allocation of tokens within the ecosystem. The chart below details the distribution plan across several components, such as the mining mechanisms Proof-of-Source and Proof-of-Control, the Srcful Foundation, and allocations for Srcful founders and investors. We strive towards a transparent approach in our model, ensuring a fair and sustainable distribution of tokens.

Please refer to the latest official documentation for the most accurate and up-to-date information, as details may evolve during the beta phase.
