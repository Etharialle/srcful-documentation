# Distribution

## Beta Phase Rewards

In a gesture of appreciation and recognition for the active beta testers and early adopters, who have actively engaged in the earliest stages of the project, Sourceful has implemented a beta rewards program.

During this phase, the pool of beta tokens will be set at **10 million Beta Points**. 

Beta testers will share this pool and be rewarded based on their uptime for the previous month. Each beta tester's share of the beta reward pool will be proportional to their individual uptime relative to the total uptime of all beta testers.
### Distribution schedule

Tokens will be distributed on a set date every month during the beta phase (2024).

| Month     | Date | Completed | Amount         |

| January   | 12th | ✅        | 4 000 000  |

## Principles after Beta Phase

Initially, the token allocation will incentivize the setup of energy gateways and the connection of distributed energy resources (DERs). This approach aims to quickly expand our network's infrastructure, creating a robust foundation for the world's largest decentralized virtual power plant.

As our network grows, the token distribution will gradually shift towards rewarding the efficient control and utilization of these resources. This transition is designed to enhance the overall effectiveness of the DER network, encouraging participants to not just deploy resources, but to actively start participating in various energy services depending on current customer demand.
