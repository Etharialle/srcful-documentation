# Distribution

The Srcful tokenomic distribution plan outlines how the total supply of SrcToken will be distributed over a period of 30 years. The plan aims to create a fair and equitable distribution of tokens that promotes decentralization and encourages widespread adoption of the Srcful platform.

The distribution plan includes mechanisms to create value for the token, such as token utility, governance, and incentivization programs. The plan allocates a certain percentage of tokens to Proof-of-Source mining, Proof-of-Control mining, and Srcful and its investors. The distribution percentages change each year, with a gradual reduction in the percentage allocated to Proof-of-Source mining and an increase in the percentage allocated to Proof-of-Control over time. Overall, the tokenomic distribution plan is designed to encourage participation, increase liquidity, and build a strong, supportive community of users and investors.

## PoS and PoC Distribution

The Srcful tokenomic distribution plan includes two mining mechanisms - Proof-of-Source (PoS) and Proof-of-Control (PoC) - which receive a certain percentage of tokens each year. The percentage allocated to each mechanism changes over time, with a gradual reduction in the percentage allocated to PoS and an increase in the percentage allocated to PoC.

The initial focus on PoS provides an incentive for users to install energy gateways, which are required for the PoS mechanism. This helps to build the infrastructure for the PoC mechanism, which becomes more profitable for users as the percentage of tokens allocated to it increases. As the PoC mechanism becomes more profitable, it is expected that more users will participate, leading to a greater overall efficiency of the distributed energy resources (DERs). 

The gradual shift towards PoC is an important part of the overall strategy for the Srcful platform, as it encourages end-users to let Srcful control their DERs and makes it more profitable for them to do so. This will benefit both the users and the Srcful platform, as it will lead to a larger and more efficient energy grid. By creating a sustainable and profitable business model for all parties involved, the PoS and PoC distribution is an integral part of Srcful's strategy to promote decentralization, encourage participation, and build a strong, supportive community of users and investors.
