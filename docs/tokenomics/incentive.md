# Incentive Structure

Srcful's incentive model for connecting Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) to the decentralized energy grid consists of two key components: Proof-of-Source and Proof-of-Control. Proof-of-Source rewards DER owners for validating their energy source and connecting their DER to the Srcful network, while PoC is an optional feature that allows Srcful to sell the energy generated by the DER on the flexibility grid service markets. Together, these features create a more sustainable and decentralized energy system and provide additional incentives for DER owners to contribute to the energy marketplace.

## Proof-of-Souce

Proof-of-Source is a key component of Srcful's incentive model for connecting Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) to the Srcful network. Proof-of-Source rewards DER owners for contributing green energy to the decentralized energy grid by validating and verifying their energy source through the use of blockchain technology.

DER owners who connect their DERs to the Srcful network and validate their energy source through Proof-of-Source receive SRC tokens as a reward. These tokens can be used to participate in the energy marketplace, or exchanged for other cryptocurrencies or fiat currency on various cryptocurrency exchanges.

The Proof-of-Source incentive model is essential for clustering a lot of DERs on the Srcful network, as it encourages DER owners to connect their DERs and participate in the energy marketplace. This clustering effect is critical for the flexibility market, as it enables a more efficient and reliable energy grid by providing a larger pool of energy resources that can be used to balance supply and demand.

By incentivizing DER owners to connect their DERs to the Srcful network through Proof-of-Source, we can create a more sustainable and decentralized energy system that benefits both DER owners and the energy market as a whole. Join us in shaping the future of energy with Srcful and start earning rewards for your green energy contributions today.

## Proof-of-Control

Proof-of-Control is the next step in the Srcful platform's incentive model for connecting Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) to the decentralized energy grid. Proof-of-Control is an optional feature that allows DER owners to give Srcful the abillity to control some functions of the DER, allowing Srcful to provide power stabilization on the flexibility grid service markets.

By enabling Proof-of-Control, DER owners can receive additional rewards for their energy contributions beyond the standard Proof-of-Source rewards. This is because Proof-of-Control allows Srcful to sell clustered DERs as a single entity on the flexibility grid service markets, which enables greater flexibility in balancing supply and demand for energy.

DER owners who enable Proof-of-Control retain full ownership of their DER and can opt out of the program at any time. 

Overall, Proof-of-Control is an important feature of the Srcful platform, as it enables greater flexibility in the energy marketplace and provides additional incentives for DER owners to contribute to the decentralized energy grid. By participating in the Proof-of-Control program, DER owners can help shape the future of energy and earn rewards for their contributions to a more sustainable and decentralized energy system.
